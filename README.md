PHP CodeIgniterDatabased Application
Databased is a self-hosted database application, allowing access to MySQL databases for non-technical people and technical people alike. With Databased we are trying to make working with MySQL databases easier and available for everyone.

Databased is not (yet) a replacement for phpMyAdmin or other MySQL administration tools as it offers only limited functionality mostly required by "regular" users. By "regular" users we mean sales staff, customer service reps, accountants etc.

Databased is built using CodeIgniter 2.1.4 and Flat UI Pro.
